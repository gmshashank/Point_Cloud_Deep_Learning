# Point_Cloud_Deep_Learning
Deep Learning on Point Clouds

CNN are applied to Images(structured data)
DGCNN tries to achieve CNN b ased performance and features on pint clouds.
Here point clouds are first converted into Graphs and then convolutions are applied on these graphs.
As compared to pointnet where only *global geometric information* was only being utilised, DGCNN extends pointnet by also utilising the *local geometric information*.This is done by applying graph convolutions
